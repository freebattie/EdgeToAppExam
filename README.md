## Question <a name="question"></a>

Greenhouse system

The client was pleased with your Greenhouse prototype (Obligatory Submission 1), but they want a custom solution that is not limited by the cloud platform you used. Use your experience from the prototype to build a custom solution for the customer. Theyâ€™ll expand the solution later, but for now they only need a Dashboard with a graph of the sensor data. The client has just started building greenhouses in 3 locations and want to use your new system to monitor all of them.

The requirements are:

- You must register and store Temperature, Humidity and Light from your ESP32 Edge device
- The client wants the solution to run on their own servers, so you must make a Node API to store the sensor data
- They want a Dashboard written in React that shows a graph of the last 24 hours of sensor data
- Deliver a video showing the final solution, all required code and written documentation. The reviewer should be able to replicate your solution.

You can build the Dashboard as either a web App or a mobile App written in Expo. If you are able to come up reasons to use other sensors in the Edge device, please do so. If you think the Dashboard needs more than just a graph, you are free to add features to the solution. Draw on your experience from the obligatory submissions and lectures to get ideas for good additions
